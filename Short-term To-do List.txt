- Add hit effects for bullet (turns to yellow)
- Add sfx for shooting, thrusters, explosion


??? Should I make the explosions move in the direction of travel for the parent node? * No. I'm going to add a "death" state where the ship stops moving and has a static electricity effect playing over top of the ship as it floats helplessly through space. After 2 seconds, the ship explodes and we instance the explosion. Logically, this makes sense as explosions seen in atmosphere don't move but instead take produce a blast in position of creation.

??? Should shields be the area2d that knockback on collisions? This would prevent players from clipping nose through shields to double-tap with shots
