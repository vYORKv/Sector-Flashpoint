	Today's Goals

1) Create Custom Ship Spawns for Test Arena ***

2) Create ShipML.tscn **
	- Figure out how inputs work with neural network
		Functions: Shoot, Forward, Reverse, StrafeLeft, StrafeRight, RotateLeft, RotateRight, Null(Cease) 
		Feed Input (Data): Enemy, Hitpoints(Self), HitsOnEnemy, HitsOnSelf, EnemyDeath, SelfDeath

3) Build Neural Network



Notes:

PascalCasing for my functions, snake_casing for native Godot functions, _snake_casing with preceding underscore for self-defined Godot functions

variables receive snake_casing, constants are capitalized SNAKE_CASING, variables referencing a node in parent node are PascalCasing
